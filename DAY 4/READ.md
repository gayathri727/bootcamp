 



### **Task 1: Understanding & Exploring Data Bias**  
- **What I Learned:**  
  - How biases can exist in AI models, including language models like ChatGPT.  
  - Methods to identify biases, such as testing responses with different inputs (e.g., left-handed vs right-handed people).  
  - The impact of bias in AI-generated content and how it can reinforce stereotypes.  

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - Finding subtle biases that arenâ€™t immediately obvious.  
  - Understanding how biases arise due to training data limitations.  

---

### **Task 2: Data Cleaning & Exploration**  
- **What I Learned:**  
  - How to explore a dataset to detect potential biases in customer churn data.  
  - Techniques for identifying missing, imbalanced, or skewed data points.  
  - The importance of preprocessing and cleaning data before analysis.  

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - Understanding what constitutes a "biased" data point in a business context.  
  - Dealing with imbalanced classes where one category dominates the dataset.  
  - Handling missing values without introducing more bias.

### **Task 3: Customer Segmentation**  
- **What I Learned:**  
  - How to use clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to segment customers.  
  - How different features (demographics, geography, behavior) influence customer groups.  
  - How to visualize segments using charts like scatter plots and bar graphs.  

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - Choosing the right number of segments for meaningful insights.  
  - Ensuring segments are distinct and actionable for business decisions.  
  - Dealing with overlapping segments where customers fit into multiple groups.  

---

### **Task 4: Identify Customer Churn Indicators**  
- **What I Learned:**  
  - How to apply statistical correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation, Chi-square test) to find factors influencing churn.  
  - Feature importance techniques (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression) to rank churn predictors.  
  - How different factors (pricing, service quality, customer engagement) contribute to churn.  

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - Identifying causation vs correlationâ€”some features may seem important but aren't the real cause.  
  - Dealing with multicollinearity (when features are too closely related).  
  - Handling categorical vs numerical data for analysis.  

---

### **Task 5: Suggest Retention Ideas**  
- **What I Learned:**  
  - How to translate data insights into business recommendations.  
  - Common churn reduction strategies, such as loyalty programs, better customer support, and pricing adjustments.  
  - The importance of A/B testing strategies before implementing solutions.  

- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - Making actionable suggestions that balance business goals with customer satisfaction.  
  - Identifying long-term vs short-term strategies for reducing churn.  
  - Justifying retention strategies with data-driven evidence.  

---

### **Overall Reflections**  
- Gained experience in bias detection, data exploration, segmentation, and predictive analytics.  
- Improved understanding of how data-driven decision-making works in customer retention.  
- Faced challenges with data imbalances, feature selection, and deriving meaningful business insights.

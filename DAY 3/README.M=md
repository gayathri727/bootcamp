Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm

What I Learned:

Explored real-world applications of data science beyond the ones in learning materials.

Learned how industries like healthcare, retail, and agriculture use data science to improve efficiency.

Difficulties Faced:

Finding unique applications that were not already covered was challenging.

Understanding how data science is specifically applied in each field required additional research.

Final Thought:

This task helped me think beyond textbook examples and explore real-world use cases.

Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram

What I Learned:

Understood the hierarchical relationship between AI, ML, and DL.

Creating a diagram made it easier to see how Machine Learning is a subset of AI and Deep Learning is a subset of ML.

Difficulties Faced:

Designing a neat and clear diagram was difficult.

Simplifying the explanation without making it too basic was a challenge.

Final Thought:

Visualizing concepts helped me understand them better, and I will try to use diagrams more in my studies.

Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research

What I Learned:

A Data Scientist has multiple responsibilities, including data preprocessing, model building, and business communication.

Not all data science roles require deep coding knowledge; some focus more on analysis and insights.

Difficulties Faced:

Differentiating between similar roles like Data Scientist and Data Engineer was confusing.

Writing concise yet informative descriptions was a challenge.

Final Thought:

Data Science involves more than just coding; business understanding and communication are equally important.

Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example

What I Learned:

Data Science follows a structured process from problem definition to model deployment.

Every step, from data collection to evaluation, is important for building an effective model.

Difficulties Faced:

Applying the lifecycle to a real-world scenario was tough since I had to break down each step.

Differentiating between steps like data preprocessing and feature engineering was challenging.

Final Thought:

Understanding the lifecycle helps in structuring projects systematically and improving efficiency.

Task 5: Python Implementation of Charts

What I Learned:

Used Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Implemented the same charts from Excel using Python, understanding their syntax and customization options.

Difficulties Faced:

Formatting the charts correctly and making them visually appealing required adjustments.

Debugging errors when handling datasets in Python took time.

Final Thought:

Using Python for data visualization is powerful and flexible, and I will continue improving my skills in it.

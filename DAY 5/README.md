### **1. Commentary Word Cloud**  
 **Learnings:**  
- Used **word clouds** to visualize word frequency in cricket commentary.  
- Learned how to **clean text data**, removing stopwords like "the," "a," etc.  
- Used **Python libraries** such as `wordcloud`, `matplotlib`, and `nltk` for text cleaning and visualization.  

 **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Removing unnecessary stopwords while keeping relevant cricket-related words.  
- Adjusting parameters to make the word cloud more readable.  

---

### **2. Commentary to Table**  
 **Learnings:**  
- Used **Regular Expressions (Regex)** to extract structured data from unstructured commentary.  
- Identified key components like **Bowler, Batter, Ball type, Shot type, Speed, and Runs scored**.  
- Understood the importance of **pattern matching** in text processing.  

 **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Writing regex patterns that accurately extract all necessary details.  
- Handling **inconsistent text formatting** in the dataset.  

---

### **3. Text Pre-processing Methods using scikit-learn**  
 **Learnings:**  
- Explored **text vectorization techniques**:  
  - **CountVectorizer()** – Converts text into a matrix of token counts.  
  - **TfidfVectorizer()** – Converts text into numerical feature vectors.  
- Understood how **feature extraction** helps in **NLP tasks** like sentiment analysis.  

**Difficulties Faced:**  
- Understanding the difference between CountVectorizer and TF-IDF.  
- Managing **memory issues** when working with large datasets.  

---

### **4. Implement TF-IDF from Scratch**  
 **Learnings:**  
- Implemented **TF-IDF manually** using mathematical formulas.  
- Understood the importance of **IDF values** in giving importance to rare words.  
- Compared manual implementation with **scikit-learn’s `TfidfVectorizer()`**.  

 **Difficulties Faced:**  
- Handling **logarithmic calculations** correctly.  
- Ensuring that **term frequencies (TF) were correctly normalized**.  

---

### **Overall Summary**  
 Learned **data cleaning, feature extraction, and text processing** techniques.  
 Gained **hands-on experience** with **TF-IDF, regex, and text vectorization**.  
 Faced challenges in **pattern recognition, memory management, and debugging regex rules** but improved logical thinking in **text analytics**.
